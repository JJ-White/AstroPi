# High quality portable astrophotography without a PC

The aim for this project is to control a Raspberry Pi camera from a smartphone, tablet, 
or computer connected to the same network. Because my main application will be astrophotography
the controls will be focussed around long exposures or other controls specific to this field.

The project will have a back-end application that captures images using the provided settings
and present a RESTful API that a web front-end will use to preview exposures and adjust parameters.

I am also planning to integrate control for the [OpenAstroTracker](https://github.com/OpenAstroTech/OpenAstroTracker)
when I build one, to make this an all in one solution for astrophotography that doesn't need a Windows 
computer.

*As you can see there's not much here yet, but keep an eye out for progress and let me know if you're
interested in using such a solution or participating in its creation.*
